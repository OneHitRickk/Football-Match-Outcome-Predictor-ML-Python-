Football-Match-Outcome-Predictor-ML-Python

This project builds a machine learning model that predicts the outcome of football matches (Win / Draw / Loss) using Python and scikit-learn.
We start with a raw CSV dataset containing detailed match statistics such as team names, venue, goals, xG, possession, and formation. 
The workflow involves cleaning, encoding, and transforming this data into a structured format suitable for machine learning models.Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess raw match data using pandas.
⁠- Engineer meaningful features for prediction (e.g., team form, opponent strength, venue impact).
- ⁠Train a Random Forest Classifier as the baseline model.
⁠- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
⁠- Experiment with additional models (e.g., Logistic Regression, XGBoost) to improve accuracy.


Tech Stack (For Now):
- Python
- Pandas – data cleaning and manipulation
- Scikit-learn – model building and evaluation
- Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization (optional later)

Current Phase:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline with pandas
- Feature selection and baseline model training using Random Forest

Future Plans:
- Add rolling match statistics (last 5-game form)
- Introduce advanced feature engineering
- Test multiple ML algorithms for performance comparison
- Visualize predictions and model insights
